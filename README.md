# Automated modeling and control of steady state engineering processes using deep active learning


## Abstract
Active learning is a form of machine learning where the model selects the next appropriate action. It has the potential to automate both modeling and control of systems/processes, yet it is underutilized in engineering application. This is likely due to its non-transparent (black box) and automated characteristics, reducing the trust of engineering practitioners. This work present the topic in a manner that is familiar to practitioners, namely as an optimization problem using geometric constraints. During exploration the operating conditions can fluctuate changing from one extreme value to the next. A constraint is developed to address this issue.
